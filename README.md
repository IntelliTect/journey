# Journey Framework
Have you ever wanted to:
   1. Write a Single Page Application (SPA) but didn't want to hassle with complex frameworks.
   2. Write regular MVC-style pages but have your application behave like a SPA.
   3. Have a fluid navigation paradigm that allows users to keep context without having to reproduce it on each screen.

The Journey is a simple javascript web framework with minimal dependencies that allows you to do these things.

Please check out the wiki for complete documentation: [Wiki Docs](https://github.com/IntelliTect/journey/wiki/Home)

###Note
Here is a short list of some of the features that are planned: 
   1. We continue to find and address navigation issues that were not forseen use cases.
   2. We would really like this to be responsive, but it isn't as of yet.
   3. Opening pages from external web sites can hihack the styling and functionality of the page. An Iframe option is coming.
