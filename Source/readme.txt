Journey Framework

Welcome to the Journey Framework! We hope you love creating great SPAs with our framework.

This jumpstart package is designed to get you going with some simple examples. A Journey Controller has been added to your project along with several views.

You can get to this controller at /journey from your application root web address.

Full documentation can be found at our project site on GitHub: https://github.com/IntelliTect/journey/
